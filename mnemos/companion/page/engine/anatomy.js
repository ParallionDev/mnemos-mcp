/* The anatomy of a mind that keeps itself, drawn in light. Every engram is a cell; every link is a fibre.
 *
 * Real parts, doing their real jobs:
 *   the body      a membrane of light: soft points spread evenly over it, so it glows like a translucent cell,
 *                 brightest at its edge, where more of it lies along the line of sight. Size is strength (how
 *                 well it is stored). A lesson is small and round, like a granule cell; an experience is a
 *                 gentle teardrop leaning toward what feeds it, like the pyramidal cells real engrams live in.
 *   the nucleus   a dense bright core: what the memory meant, the part made to outlive the rest. Inside it a
 *                 nucleolus, brighter still, as big as the memory is settled (stability): a lesson's is large.
 *   the cytoplasm fine granules inside the body, as many as the memory is strongly stored (strength): the
 *                 Nissl substance that makes a real neuron's body look grainy under the microscope.
 *   the dendrites the arbour that receives: a few boughs that fork and thin, reaching toward the memories
 *                 that link in, and fading into the tissue as real arbours do. Their finer branches carry
 *                 spines, the small heads where synapses sit: the more links a memory has, the more spines.
 *   the fibres    one per link: an axon leaving the sender at its hillock, arcing over, and arriving along
 *                 the receiver's surface in a bouton on its body. Beads along it (the varicosities real axons
 *                 have, where they release) come closer together the stronger the link. Recall's light
 *                 travels along it.
 * Words appear only where they mean something, and the page sets those itself: a memory being read, what
 * was said becoming a memory, a lesson's meaning. `wrap` gives the page the line a sentence takes round a
 * body, pole to pole, so words can land on the memory they become.
 *
 * This returns plain geometry; renderers decide how bright each point is at each moment. */
